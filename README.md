We experimented with a new proof-of-concept for the 6D pose estimation problem. We are inspired by conventional computer vision approaches that
fuse information coming from different granularities to make a global prediction, and put forward an end-to-end pose estimation pipeline that relies on a similar reason-
ing. In brief, we propose to split point cloud data coming from the depth map of detected objects into different regions and merge it with color embedding information. We experi-
mented with different methods that utilize such a strategy for 6D pose estimation
